# A-Time-Series-Approach-to-Modelling-Groundwater-Dynamics
Developed a Combined Regression Strategy, COBRA, for time series modelling of Groundwater dynamics, achieving a validation Mean Absolute Error(MAE) of 0.0071. Conducted a comparative analysis of models, including LSTMs, GRUs, Highway Bidirectional LSTMs, a hybrid Bidirectional LSTM-GRU, Transformers and COBRA.
